### Project: Analizing the relationship between English church appointments and population of settlements in 1550-1800.
### The H0 hypothesis: The English church appintments effected on population of English settlements in 1550-1800.
The time frame is 1550-1800 and has a step of 25 years.
How: by collecting population data and church appintments data I constracted the dataset that includes (for each city, for each year) population and number of appintments that took place
Appointments: I deicded to count in only appointments where multiple people were present (at least two)
As having an appointment with only one person, would not affect the population, because besides the attendee and priest (or any other person that serves in church) there are no other people for the attendee to meet. I don't count as a meeting -- meeting the person who serves in church, as these attendee meets the church service people multiple times, and they are not unique with every appointment in the church.
